Welcome to auto25.ee, where you will find all the cars your heart could desire. Yes, all 10 of them!

## The website

The website provides you, the user, the opportunity to filter cars with different specifications, compare them, as well as giving you the opportunity to check specifications of singular cars. You can also find information about the manufacturers themselves.

The website is built using HTML and CSS. The server is run in Golang, and it pulls its data from an API. 

## How to get there?

To access the site, you must first run the API. You can do so by:

1. Navigating into the cars/api folder, and using ```make run```. 
2. Running the main.go program in the cars/ folder using ```go run .```. 
3. Navigating to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) to use the website itself!
