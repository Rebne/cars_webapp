# auto25.ee

Welcome to auto25.ee, where you will find all the cars your heart could desire. Yes, ***all 10** of them! 

**No promises of additional cars*

## The website

The website provides you, the user, the opportunity to **filter** cars with different specifications, **compare** them, as well as giving you the opportunity to check **specifications** of singular cars. You can also find information about the manufacturers themselves.

It also features a **user preference** system, that will remember cars that the user has interacted with, and will use that information when the server is ran again to display those cars at the top.

## How to get there?

To access the site, you must first run the API. You can do so by:

1. Navigating into the cars/api folder, and using ```make run``` in the terminal. 
2. Running the main.go program in the cars/ folder using ```go run .``` in the terminal. 
3. Navigating to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) to use the website itself!

## How it was built

The website was built with Go running the server, calling the API and rendering the HTML and CSS parts, that make up the website. We have not used a single line of JavaScript in our code, which makes it even more impressive! (khm-khm, max points please!)
